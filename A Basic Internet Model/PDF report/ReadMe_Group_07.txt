A Basic Internet Model
This project "A BASIC INTERNET MODEL" is focused on working of the networks.
Here, we connect systems under a network to other systems using routers. Devices 
connect to routers of unique IP address through which the information stored in 
databases is exchanged among users. Further, the information is accessed using 
routing tables, and they help in choosing the shortest path from your router to 
the desired database and if the path is found successfully, the network provides 
you with the piece of information you want in the form of discrete data packets, 
otherwise, if the connection establishment fails, the program shows "Server not found" 
on the screen.
